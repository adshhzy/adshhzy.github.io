I implemented the core technque of the paper "Video Textures", and an
extension technque in the paper which let user to control the speed of
a repeated motion by specifying the key frame S, given a input video
which describes a repeated motion in different speed (The Runner part
in the paper). <br>
<br>
I also explored the influence of the choice of the parameters and the importance of some key steps.<br>
<br>
Here I first write down the core pipeline of the paper, which is also been implemented in this project.<br>
<br>
1. Given a input video, compute the SSD between every pair of frames, store it into matrix D:<br>
<img src="dmatrix.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
2. To preserve the dynamics,&nbsp; the SSD between every pair of frames
is replaced by the weighted sum of the SSD across a window of frames.
This equals to apply a diagonal filter on the original D matrix. For
example, it can be written into&nbsp; D'_ij = \sum w_k D_{i+k,j+k}
where k = (-w,-w+1,...,w-1), and w is the filter size.<br>
<br>

<br>
3. To avoid the problem falls into dead end and make the transition
probability to be able to anticipating the future, use Q-learning to
'filter' the matrix D' to make D'', in Q-learning, we follow the
suggested update equation in the paper:<br>
<img src="qlearning.png" alt=""><br>
<br>
4. Compute the P matrix using<img src="Pmatrix.png" alt=""> for normal cases, or <img src="Pcontrol.png" alt="">for the motion speed controling cases.<br>
<br>
5. Prune the P matrix using non-maximal suppression on each row and set
the value below a threshold to be 0. Renormalize each row to sum to 1.<br>
<br>
6. Build the output video based on the transition probability on P.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here we use the generation curve (<span style="font-weight: bold;">Original Frame--Generated Frame</span>) to discuss the importance or the function of some steps above.<br>
<br>
1. For the third step which we use to avoid the dead end, there is a
wrong notation in the equations in the paper, to get the true updated
equation we shoule replace the <img src="djk.png" alt=""> with <img src="dj1.png" alt="">. And for the last frame, we set a big value to <img style="width: 105px; height: 31px;" src="mindjk.png" alt="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
, which can be explained as we want to penalize the reach of the last
frame under the assumption that usually the final frame will not match
any previous frame. Then during the iteration, the q-learning gradually
propagates the the penalty from the last frame to the previous frames
(from back to front), and force the previous frames to have a high
probability to make change to other similar frames away from the last
frames, instead of having a high chance to change to next frame. Then
the propagation ends until a good transition appear. If we use the
wrong notation, we got nothing to update because the minimization term
is zero all the time. The key here is propagation of the penalty from
the last frame to the previous frames, which is not mentioned in the
paper.<br>
<br>
2. The fifth step which we prune the P matrix is a key step to make the
video smooth and get rid of local repetition, as frames are very
similar to its neighborhood frames, if we dont apply the non-maximal
suppression, when generating new videos, we can easily get the
transitions around neighborhood frames, which make the video unsmooth.
We show the generation curve with or without the pruning step in the
Hummingbirds video as example. (We use a patial sequence of the
original Hummingbirds video as input ):<br>

<br>
3. To illustrate the effectiveness of the motion speed controling, we
also give the generation curve with different S. As we can see, the
generated video does sample around the picking frame S. (The link of
the generated video can be found in the link at the last of the page)<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
4. Last but not the least,&nbsp; the sigma in the equation for getting
P from D,&nbsp; also plays a key role in video smoothness as it
controls the allowance of poor transition. A good sigma varies from
different input videos, we choose the good one by looking at the
smoothness of the generation curve manually.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Now we give some other results, we show generation curve here, and you
can download the video from the link in the end of the page.<br>

Figure 5: Generation curve for waterfalls video suggested by Robert<br>
(In the original video there is a transition from a waterfall scene to
another one, which uses fadeout to make a smooth transition, so after
the video went through that transition, it can only repeat in the later
scene as it costs too high to transit back to the first scene)<br>
